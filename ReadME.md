This app is designed to use the SQL database to store information about a store order and inventory.
In the app I created you can add your own order, check to see how many of each item is in stock and check the price on a specific item before you buy it.

You begin the app in the console by typing "node index.js".

The app will prompt you to make a selection and explain itself from there.

It will ask:

What would you like to do?

"Buy something?"
"Find item cost"
OR
"Find out how many are in stock"

Please check out my screen shots that will show you that the app is working.

Have Fun and thanks for playing.
