This app is designed to use the SQL database to store information about a store order and inventory.
In the app I created you can add your own order, check to see if an order is in stock and check to see
how many of an item has been sold.

You begin the app in the console by typing node "index.js".

The app will prompt you to make a selection and explain itself from there.
